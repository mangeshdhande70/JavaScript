********** DOM Imp(Document Object Model) ****************

  1. document      => it is used to select all the body of html
  2. createElement => it is used to create new Elements such as "li,div,h1,h2 and all....etc"
  3. createTextNode => it is used to create new text by using it we optimize the way to update or create new Element
  4. querySelector  => used to select any class or id.
  5. querySelectorAll
  6. eventPropagation => capturing & bubbling. 
     1. Bubbling:- When an event happens on a component, it first runs the event handler on it, then on its parent component, then all the way up on other ancestorsâ€™ components. By default, all event handles through this order from center component event to outermost component event.
   
     2. Capturing:- It is the opposite of bubbling. The event handler is first on its parent component and then on the component where it was actually wanted to fire that event handler. In short, it means that the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements. It is also called trickle down.
